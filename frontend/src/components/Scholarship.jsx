        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-center mb-10">
          College can be expensive, but there are many ways to make it affordable. Financial aid is money that helps you pay for college, and it can come from the government, your college, or private organizations. There are several main types of financial aid:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 max-w-2xl mx-auto">
          <li>
            <strong>Grants:</strong> Free money for college that you donâ€™t have to pay back. Grants are usually based on your financial need.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Scholarships:</strong> Free money awarded for things like good grades, special talents, or being part of a certain group. You donâ€™t have to pay scholarships back.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Work-Study:</strong> A program that lets you work part-time (often on campus) to help pay for your education.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Loans:</strong> Money you borrow for college that you must pay back with interest after you graduate or leave school.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-center mb-8">
          Most students use a mix of these options to pay for college. The next step is learning about the FAFSA, which is the main way to apply for federal and many state and college financial aid programs.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-center">What is FAFSA?</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 max-w-2xl mx-auto">
          <li>
            <strong>FAFSA:</strong> FAFSA stands for Free Application for Federal Student Aid. Itâ€™s a form that students in the U.S. fill out to get money to help pay for college.
